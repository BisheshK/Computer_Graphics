Aim: To implement the midpoint circle generation algorithm or Bresenham’s circle algorithm for drawing a circle of a given  center (x, y) and radius r. 
 
Theory:

The Midpoint Circle Generation Algorithm efficiently determines the coordinates needed to draw a circle. It uses the symmetry of circles to reduce computational effort. The algorithm evaluates a decision parameter to determine the next pixel, avoiding floating-point arithmetic. This approach allows for rapid, accurate circle drawing and is common in graphics applications.


Description: 

Circles have the property of being highly symmetrical, which is handy when it comes to drawing them on a display screen. We know that there are 360 degrees in a circle.

1) First, we see that a circle is symmetrical about the x-axis, so only the first 180 degrees need to be calculated. 

2) Next, we see that it's also symmetrical about the y-axis, so now we only need to calculate the first 90 degrees. 

3) Finally, we see that the circle is also symmetrical about the 45 degree diagonal axis, so we only need to calculate the first 45 degrees. We only need to calculate the values for the border of the circle in the first octant, which covers 0 to 45 degrees. 

The coordinates for the remaining parts of the circle can be found by reflecting these points across the axes due to the circle's symmetry. 

Bresenham's circle algorithm calculates the locations of the pixels in the first 45 degrees. It assumes that the circle is centered on the origin. So for every pixel (x, y), it calculates, we draw a pixel in each of the eight octants of the circle. This is done until the value of the y-coordinate equals the x-coordinate. The pixel positions for determining symmetry are given in the algorithm below.

Algorithm: 
 
1. Input radius r and circle centre (xc, yc), then set the coordinates for the first point on the circumference of a circle centred on the origin as: 
(x0,y0) = (0,r)
 
2. Calculate the initial value of the decision parameter as: 
p0 = 5/4 - r

3. Starting with k = 0 at each position xk, perform the following test. If pk < 0, the next point along the circle centred on (0, 0) is (xk+1, yk) and: 
p(k+1) = pk + 2*x(k+1) + 1

Otherwise the next point along the circle is (xk+1, yk-1) and: 
p(k+1) = pk + 2*x(k+1) + 1 - 2*y(k+1)

4. Determine symmetry points in the other seven octants 

5. Move each calculated pixel position (x, y) onto the circular path centred at (xc, yc) to plot the coordinate values:

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until x >= y 
x = x + x * c
y = y + y * c
