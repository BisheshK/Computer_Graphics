Bresenham’s Line Algorithm:

An algorithm which determines which order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two given points.

Aim: To implement Bresenham’s line drawing algorithm for drawing a line segment between two
given endpoints A (x1, y2) and B(x2, y2). 

Description:
    Basic Concept:
        Move across the x axis in unit intervals and at each step choose between two different y coordinates. 

        For example, from position (2, 3) we have to choose between (3, 3) and (3, 4). We would like the point that is closer to the original line. 
        
        So we have to take decision to choose next point. So next pixels are selected based on the value of decision parameter p. The equations are given in below algorithm. 

    Algorithm:
        1. Input the two line end-points, storing the left end-point in (x0, y0).
        2. Plot the point (x0, y0). 
        3. Calculate the constants Δx, Δy, 2Δy, and (2Δy - 2Δx) and get the first value for the decision parameter as:

            p0 = 2del(y) - del(x)
        
        4. At each xk along the line, starting at k = 0, perform the following test. If pk < 0, the next point to plot is  (xk+1, yk ) and: 
        
            p(k+1) = pk + 2 del(y)
        
        Otherwise, the next point to plot is (xk+1, yk+1) and:
        
            p(k+1) = pk + 2 del(y) - 2 del(x)
        
        5. Repeat step 4 (Δx – 1) times.
